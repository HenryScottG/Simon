Project 
Simon is a game to test your memory. 

Idea of the game
The purpose of the game is to have a sequence of different colors display at random and prompt the player to repeat the same sequence. 

Technology Used
The game was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScrip.
The functionality includes:
  * Clicking "How To Play" to display the instructions. 
  * Clicking "Start" to begin the game.
  * If the pattern is followed successfully, the player wins and the Score will increase. 
  * If the pattern is incorrect, the player loses. 
  * There is also an "End" button if the player wants to stop the game.
  
Approach Used
Used Wireframing to visualize the page layout.

 * Putting the Score at the top of the screen helps the end user quickly see how they are doing. 
 * The layout was all centralized on the screen to help keep the focus in one area.
